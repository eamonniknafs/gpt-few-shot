# Few-Shot Q/A with GPT-3 Codex
This notebook demonstrates that providing GPT-3 Codex a few-shot context can improve its accuracy. The questions being asked are all complex machine learning questions, so Codex often answers them incorrectly at zero-shot. However, when we provide a few-shot context of similar questions, Codex is more likely to answer correctly.
